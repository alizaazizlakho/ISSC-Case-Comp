## General

Our team ✨Statistically Significant✨ won the award for Best Presentation at the Independent Summer Statistics Community Case Competition. We geared our presentation towards young professionals looking to move to Toronto, and analyzed what the various factors a young professional would consider when making this decision.

## Safety in Toronto

To start, we looked at neighbourhoods to avoid based on different crime rate in Toronto in 2020.
Please note that the legend is standardized to the number of crime per 100,000 inhabitants.
We see that:
* Assault, break and enter and robbery is higher in old Toronto region (particularly in midtown and downtown)
* Auto theft, theft over and shooting is higher in northern etobicoke region and some region in North York.

To turn our attention back to livability. Top right we found the 10 safest neighborhoods to live in Toronto in 2020. 
To make sure the snapshot of 2020 isn’t due to an outlier - top right we plotted the crime rate of the lowest 10 crime rate neighborhoods, highest 5 crime rate neighborhoods, Toronto’s average crime rate, and Canada’s 2020 crime rate according to wikipedia. Our finding is shown on slide in bullet points.

## Toronto's Public Transit

In Toronto, even though the biggest mode of transportation is driving, over 24% of working people commute to work by using public transit

Throughout Toronto, there are many TTC stops, including buses, streetcars, and subway stations.
It is easy to get almost anywhere in Toronto using public transit, since it is all connected, and the TTC does not only go to the city centre

## Limitations

We had a few limitaions when working on the projects. A few of them are listed below:
* There was a lack of 2021 data, sometimes we had to work with data not updated recenlty.
* Sample size: The sample size in our survey design is small, and a larger sample size will be more representative to our groups of interest
* There was a time constraint owing to this project being completed duing a Case Competition.




## Bibliography

Sample size: The sample size in our survey design is small, and a larger sample size will be more representative to our groups of interest. The links are posted below. (Some would be updated soon!):
